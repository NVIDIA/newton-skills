## Description: <br>
Independently verify a Newton simulation claim with bounds, invariants, sensitivity tests, or references. Not for finding and fixing the root cause of an existing failure. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
CC-BY-4.0 AND Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers using the Newton physics simulator use this skill to independently verify what a simulation result establishes, selecting falsifying checks (finite states, invariants, contact and penetration, actuator/travel limits, timestep or seed sensitivity, reference comparisons) and reporting passed, failed, and unverified claims separately from real-world validity. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-5-5`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-6.1-sol`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
8 evaluation tasks (4 positive, 4 negative), 1 attempt per task, run in the `k8s-sandbox` environment with each task attempt in its own isolated sandbox pod; each task was also attempted without the skill as a baseline. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Is it safe to use? Scored from `security` (100%). <br>
- Correctness: Is the answer correct? Scored from `accuracy` (100%). <br>
- Discoverability: Was the right skill loaded when needed? Scored from `skill_execution` (100%). <br>
- Effectiveness: Did the skill help complete the task? Scored from `goal_accuracy` (50%) + `behavior_check` (50%). <br>
- Efficiency: Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage? Scored from `skill_efficiency` (50%) + `token_efficiency` (50%). <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Security: unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Skill Execution: whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool Productivity: tool-call productivity (legacy wire id; routing is scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `accuracy`: Accuracy: final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Goal Accuracy: whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Behavior Check: whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Token Efficiency: actual uncached prompt plus completion usage (50% of Efficiency). <br>

### Results at a Glance

| Measure | Claude Code (Baseline → Skill Uplift) | Codex (Baseline → Skill Uplift) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Overall | 99.1% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable | 87.5% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable |
| Security | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) | 100.0% → 87.5% (-12.5 points) |
| Correctness | 97.5% → 97.5% (±0.0 points) | 80.0% → 92.5% (+12.5 points) |
| Discoverability | 100.0% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable | 93.8% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable |
| Effectiveness | 93.8% → 100.0% (+6.2 points) | 98.4% → 84.4% (-14.0 points) |
| Efficiency | 98.0% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable | 79.5% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable |

**How to read this table:** baseline is the same task attempted without the target skill. Scores are rounded to one decimal; threshold-adjacent values use additional precision so their displayed band matches the verdict. Uplift is derived from those displayed scores and shown in percentage points.

Example: `47.0% → 92.0% (+45.0 points)` means the skill-assisted run scored 92.0%, 45.0 percentage points above its 47.0% no-skill baseline.

A partial dimension was calculated from only the available configured signals; review the detailed report before relying on it.

#### Comparison details

Shared-source comparisons use the same signals and weights on both conditions. They do not replace the full dimension scores above or change the publication verdict.

| Agent | Dimension | Basis | Baseline → With skill (uplift) | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| claude-code | Discoverability | Dimension comparison | N/A | Discoverability is not applicable to the no-skill baseline; there is no installed skill to discover. |
| claude-code | Efficiency | Token-only comparison | 96.7% → 96.0% (-0.7 points) | Only Token Efficiency is comparable; the full dimension scores use different evaluator sources. |
| codex | Discoverability | Dimension comparison | N/A | Discoverability is not applicable to the no-skill baseline; there is no installed skill to discover. |
| codex | Efficiency | Token-only comparison | 89.5% → 88.1% (-1.4 points) | Only Token Efficiency is comparable; the full dimension scores use different evaluator sources. |
